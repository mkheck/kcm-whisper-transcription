The company's gross profit margin stood at 58%, with EBITDA reaching $37.5 million, translating to a 30% EBITDA margin. Net income increased to $16 million from $10 million in Q2 2022. The growth is attributed to the expansion of their high yield savings product line and the new RoboAdvisor platform.

The company's total assets reached $1.5 billion, with total liabilities at $900 million. Organic user growth continues, with a drop in customer acquisition cost and a growth in lifetime value. Risk management measures are in place, with a healthy tier-one capital ratio of 12.5%. The company forecasts an 8% quarter-over-quarter growth in revenues for the next quarter, driven by blockchain and AI analytic solutions. An upcoming IPO of the subsidiary, Pay Plus, is expected to raise $200 million, bolstering liquidity and enabling growth.
